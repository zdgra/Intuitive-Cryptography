**Disclaimer**: These solutions have already been publicly posted by the professor on his course pages.

My love for number theory and problem solving led me to become the teaching assistant for my school's cryptography course from Fall 2020 - Fall 2021. During this time, I and my fellow TAs were asked to help write solutions for the assignments, and when it came time to pick which assignments I'd write for, I knew *instantly* it'd be the number theory-focused ones.

These are the solutions I wrote for Fall 2021. I'm proud of how accessible and intuitive I made it for everyone, as there was a large range of comfort with number theory in the class. I care a lot about good mathematics education, and I wish to show that here!

If you want to find one question that encompasses my best work, check out problem 7 of the Number Theory assignment!
