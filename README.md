My love for number theory and problem solving led me to become the teaching assistant for my school's cryptography course from Fall 2020 - Fall 2021. During this time, I and my fellow TAs were asked to help write solutions for the assignments, and when it came time to pick which assignments I'd write for, I knew *instantly* it'd be the number theory-focused ones.

These are the solutions I wrote for Fall 2021. I'm proud of how accessible and intuitive I made it for everyone, as there was a large range of comfort with number theory in the class. I care a lot about good mathematics education, and I wish to show that here!

You can find my best work in problems 3, 4, and 7 of the Number Theory assignment.
